# Next.js REST API with TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Next.js App Router and TypeScript. The API provides endpoints to manage users and posts with full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project is designed with clean code principles, modularity, and scalability in mind.

---

## Features

- **Endpoints for Users and Posts**: 
  - Manage users and their associated posts.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods.
- **TypeScript Integration**:
  - Strongly typed models and services.
- **JSON File as Database**:
  - Mock data is stored in JSON files (`users.json` and `posts.json`), simulating a file-based database.
- **Clean Architecture**:
  - Modular structure separating routes, models, services, and utilities.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code readability.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Postman**: Used for API testing.
